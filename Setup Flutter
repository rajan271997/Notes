4. Set the flutter path in terminal or command line :  export PATH="$PATH:`pwd`/flutter/bin"
5. Great !! Now you are ready to run flutter.



Sometimes We have to add some dependencies to run flutter .

 To check these dependencies , run the following command : 
    “flutter doctor”

If there is any dependencies to show, you can simply check the suggestions and or use google to solve.

To set the path default for flutter : 

1. Open the terminal and run the command :  “nano ~/.bash_profile”
2. Add the following line and change [PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY] to be the path where you cloned Flutter’s Git repository is: “export PATH=[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin:$PATH”  For Example :  “export PATH=~/Downloads/flutter/bin:$PATH”
3. Press Ctrl + X and when it asks you to save the file, choose Yes
4. Run source $HOME/.bash_profile to refresh the current window or restart the terminal.
5. echo $PATH

Notice that [PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY] is where you installed Flutter SDK, not the location of your app
Instead of nano, you can use any text editor to edit file ~/.bash_profile.
